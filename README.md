## About project

This is improved version of [Moto_Blog](https://github.com/pythonowiec/Moto_Blog). I rewrite frontend in React & Bootstrap. I have built API in Larvel.

Some technologies and packages:

- Laravel
- React.
- Bootstrap.
- Auth0
- Axios
- Cloudinary for store posts's images
- FingerprintJS
- Pusher
- MySql


## What it's doing?

In this app admin can create/update/delete posts. User can comment every post and liked comment. I used fingerprint to recognize device and one the device user can give one vote on the comment. Addictionaly if user put comment on site. Admin give pusher notification on his profile.
